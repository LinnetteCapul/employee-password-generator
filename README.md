# Employee Password Generator

## Description

I created an application for employees to generate random passwords based on the parameters that the employee has selected. The application is accesible when opened in a browser. The applications allows the employee to select various criteria when prompted on what the user wants to include such as upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. The application also gives the option on how many characters the password can be ranging between 8 and 128 characters long. Although the employee can choose what type of characters can be include in their password, they must select at least one of the criteria in order for the application to generate a random password. After the user answers all the prompts, the application will create a randomized password based on the critera selected. Finally, the randomized generated password will be displayed in the application for the employee to use.
